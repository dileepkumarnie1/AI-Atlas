## Session 2025-10-07T00:00Z (Local Date 2025-10-07)
Chat ID: session-2025-10-07-001

### High-Level Themes
- Repo sync & git rebase operations (multiple confirmations repo clean after rebase)
- Playwright UI test expansion for search feature (attempted SR-006..SR-025 cases)
- Difficulty persisting expanded test cases into `tests/run_ui_tests.py` (edits not sticking)
- Permissions check confirming FullControl on file
- Request to add additional search test coverage (positive, negative, edge)

### Key Outstanding Items
1. Search test plan still only includes SR-001..SR-005 (needs reinsertion of extended cases if still desired)
2. No handlers yet for added search scenarios
3. Need 5 new test cases (pos/neg/edge) once base expansion strategy finalized

### Notable Files Mentioned
- `tests/run_ui_tests.py`
- `public/tools.json`
- `data/popularity_raw.json`
- `.gitignore`

### Next Proposed Steps (If Continuing)
- Re-attempt atomic replacement of search section using precise patch
- Add five new cases (suggest IDs SR-026..SR-030) after restoring SR-006..SR-025
- Implement handlers incrementally and validate with a dry run

## Session 2025-10-08T00:00Z (Local Date 2025-10-08)
Chat ID: session-2025-10-08-001

### High-Level Themes
- Introduced and committed JSON Schema for tools catalog (`schema/tools.schema.json`).
- Added validation script (`scripts/validate-tools-schema.mjs`) and npm script `tools:schema:validate`.
- Enhanced CI workflow: added explicit permissions (issues/pull-requests write) and simplified failure issue conditions.
- Addressed issue creation failure ("Resource not accessible by integration") by adjusting permissions & removing fork-dependent logic.
- Synced local repo with upstream changes (popularity data and tools list updates) via fast-forward rebase.
- Prepared to maintain ongoing conversation log for tooling & test infrastructure evolution.

### Key Changes Landed
| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Data Integrity | Tools schema drafted (draft-07) enforcing structure & formats |
| Validation | Ajv-based validator script added, Windows path resolution handled |
| CI Workflow | Permissions block extended: contents read, issues write, pull-requests write |
| Failure Reporting | Removed fragile fork detection; conditional issue creation on failures only |
| Git Sync | Pulled remote updates (popularity metrics & tools.json modifications) |

### Current State
- `public/tools.json` passes schema validation.
- Failure summary + issue automation operational; awaiting next failing run to confirm issue creation under new permissions.
- Latest popularity and ranking data integrated (large diff from upstream fast-forward).

### Pending / Potential Next Steps
1. Add automated schema validation job on push/PR.
2. Implement enrichment script (tag normalization, duplicate detection).
3. Generate a quality report artifact (counts, missing optional fields, tag stats).
4. Expand test coverage (negative schema test, enrichment tests).
5. Consider adding IDs or `addedAt` field to schema (requires schema update & backfill).

### Risks / Watch Items
- Issue creation still untested post-permission change (needs a simulated failure run).
- Large popularity data changes could mask future driftâ€”consider checksum reporting.

### Quick Reference Commands
```
npm run tools:schema:validate   # Validate tools.json
```

### Summary
Foundation for data contract & CI reporting is now stable; focus can shift to enrichment & quality guardrails.
